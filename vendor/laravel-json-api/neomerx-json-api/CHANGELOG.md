## [5.0.1] - 2022-06-25

### Fixed

- [#3](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/neomerx-json-api/issues/3) The encoder now omits the top-level `meta` member
  if the meta value is set to `null`. Previously it was encoding `null` into the JSON:API document, which did not
  conform to the interface which says that: "If 'null' meta will not appear in a document."
- [#3](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/neomerx-json-api/issues/3) The encoder now omits the top-level `meta` member
  if the meta value is an empty array. Previously it was encoding an empty array as the JSON value. This does not
  confirm to the JSON:API specification, which states that the `meta` member must be an object.
